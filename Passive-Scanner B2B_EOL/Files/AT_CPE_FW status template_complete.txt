CVE-2019-13025 (Compal CH7465LG CH7465LG-NCIP-6.12.18.24-5p8-NOSH devices have Incorrect Access Control because of Improper Input Validation. The attacker can send a maliciously modified POST (HTTP) request containing shell commands, which will be executed on the device, to an backend API endpoint of the cable modem.) CVE-2019-17224 (The web interface of the Compal Broadband CH7465LG modem (version CH7465LG-NCIP-6.12.18.25-2p6-NOSH) is vulnerable to a /%2f/ path traversal attack, which can be exploited in order to test for the existence of a file pathname outside of the web root directory. If a file exists but is not part of the product, there is a 404 error. If a file does not exist, there is a 302 redirect to index.html.) CVE-2019-17499 (The setter.xml component of the Common Gateway Interface on Compal CH7465LG 6.12.18.25-2p4 devices does not properly validate ping command arguments, which allows remote authenticated users to execute OS commands as root via shell metacharacters in the Target_IP parameter.)

CVE-2017-15226 (Zyxel NBG6716 V1.00(AAKG.9)C0 devices allow command injection in the ozkerz component because beginIndex and endIndex are used directly in a popen call.) CVE-2017-6884 (A command injection vulnerability was discovered on the Zyxel EMG2926 home router with firmware V1.00(AAQT.4)b8. The vulnerability is located in the diagnostic tools, specifically the nslookup function. A malicious user may exploit numerous vectors to execute arbitrary commands on the router, such as the ping_ip parameter to the expert/maintenance/diagnostic/nslookup URI.) CVE-2019-17354 (wan.htm page on Zyxel NBG-418N v2 with firmware version V1.00(AARP.9)C0 can be accessed directly without authentication, which can lead to disclosure of information about the WAN, and can also be leveraged by an attacker to modify data fields of the page.)
