12.2
CVE-2001-0537 (HTTP server for Cisco IOS 11.3 to 12.2 allows attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands, when local authorization is being used, by specifying a high access level in the URL.) CVE-2001-0929 (Cisco IOS Firewall Feature set, aka Context Based Access Control (CBAC) or Cisco Secure Integrated Software, for IOS 11.2P through 12.2T does not properly check the IP protocol type, which could allow remote attackers to bypass access control lists.) CVE-2001-1071 (Cisco IOS 12.2 and earlier running Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a flood of CDP neighbor announcements.) CVE-2001-1097 (Cisco routers and switches running IOS 12.0 through 12.2.1 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via a flood of UDP packets.) CVE-2001-1183 (PPTP implementation in Cisco IOS 12.1 and 12.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed packet.) CVE-2002-0339 (Cisco IOS 11.1CC through 12.2 with Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) enabled includes portions of previous packets in the padding of a MAC level packet when the MAC packet's length is less than the IP level packet length.) CVE-2002-1024 (Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.2, when supporting SSH, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a large packet that was designed to exploit the SSH CRC32 attack detection overflow (CVE-2001-0144).) CVE-2002-1706 (Cisco IOS software 11.3 through 12.2 running on Cisco uBR7200 and uBR7100 series Universal Broadband Routers allows remote attackers to modify Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) settings via a DOCSIS file without a Message Integrity Check (MIC) signature, which is approved by the router.) CVE-2002-1768 (Cisco IOS 11.1 through 12.2, when HSRP support is not enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via randomly sized UDP packets to the Hot Standby Routing Protocol (HSRP) port 1985.) CVE-2002-2208 (Extended Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), as implemented in Cisco IOS 11.3 through 12.2 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (flood) by sending a large number of spoofed EIGRP neighbor announcements, which results in an ARP storm on the local network.) CVE-2002-2379 (** DISPUTED **  Cisco AS5350 IOS 12.2(11)T with access control lists (ACLs) applied and possibly with ssh running allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a port scan, possibly due to an ssh bug. NOTE: this issue could not be reproduced by the vendor.) CVE-2003-0305 (The Service Assurance Agent (SAA) in Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.2, aka Response Time Reporter (RTR), allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via malformed RTR packets to port 1967.) CVE-2003-0511 (The web server for Cisco Aironet AP1x00 Series Wireless devices running certain versions of IOS 12.2 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reload) via a malformed URL.) CVE-2003-0512 (Cisco IOS 12.2 and earlier generates a "% Login invalid" message instead of prompting for a password when an invalid username is provided, which allows remote attackers to identify valid usernames on the system and conduct brute force password guessing, as reported for the Aironet Bridge.) CVE-2003-0567 (Cisco IOS 11.x and 12.0 through 12.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic block) by sending a particular sequence of IPv4 packets to an interface on the device, causing the input queue on that interface to be marked as full.) CVE-2003-0647 (Buffer overflow in the HTTP server for Cisco IOS 12.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an extremely long (2GB) HTTP GET request.) CVE-2003-1109 (The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation in multiple Cisco products including IP Phone models 7940 and 7960, IOS versions in the 12.2 train, and Secure PIX 5.2.9 to 6.2.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted INVITE messages, as demonstrated by the OUSPG PROTOS c07-sip test suite.) CVE-2003-1398 (Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.2, when IP routing is disabled, accepts false ICMP redirect messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (network routing modification).) CVE-2004-0054 (Multiple vulnerabilities in the H.323 protocol implementation for Cisco IOS 11.3T through 12.2T allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated by the NISCC/OUSPG PROTOS test suite for the H.225 protocol.)

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP: Versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system.

CVE-2018-0275 (A vulnerability in the support tunnel feature of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access the device's shell. The vulnerability is due to improper configuration of the support tunnel feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking the device into unlocking the support user account and accessing the tunnel password and device serial number. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run any system command with root access. This affects Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) software versions prior to 2.2.0.470. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf54409.)
