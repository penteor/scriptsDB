CVE-2013-4689 (J-Web in Juniper Junos before 10.4R13, 11.4 before 11.4R7, 12.1R before 12.1R6, 12.1X44 before 12.1X44-D15, 12.1x45 before 12.1X45-D10, 12.2 before 12.2R3, 12.3 before 12.3R2, and 13.1 before 13.1R3 allow remote attackers to bypass the cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection mechanism and hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) create new administrator accounts or (2) have other unspecified impacts.) CVE-2013-4690 (Juniper Junos 10.4 before 10.4S13, 11.4 before 11.4R7-S1, 12.1 before 12.1R5-S3, 12.1X44 before 12.1X44-D20, and 12.1X45 before 12.1X45-D10 on the SRX1400, SRX3400, and SRX3600 does not properly initialize memory locations used during padding of Ethernet packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading packet data, aka PR 829536, a related issue to CVE-2003-0001.) CVE-2013-6013 (Buffer overflow in the flow daemon (flowd) in Juniper Junos 10.4 before 10.4S14, 11.4 before 11.4R7-S2, 12.1.X44 before 12.1X44-D15, 12.1X45 before 12.1X45-D10 on SRX devices, when using telnet pass-through authentication on the firewall, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted telnet message.) CVE-2014-0618 (Juniper Junos before 10.4 before 10.4R16, 11.4 before 11.4R8, 12.1R before 12.1R7, 12.1X44 before 12.1X44-D20, and 12.1X45 before 12.1X45-D10 on SRX Series service gateways, when used as a UAC enforcer and captive portal is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (flowd crash) via a crafted HTTP message.) CVE-2014-2714 (The Enhanced Web Filtering (EWF) in Juniper Junos before 10.4R15, 11.4 before 11.4R9, 12.1 before 12.1R7, 12.1X44 before 12.1X44-D20, 12.1X45 before 12.1X45-D10, and 12.1X46 before 12.1X46-D10, as used in the SRX Series services gateways, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (flow daemon crash and restart) via a crafted URL.)
